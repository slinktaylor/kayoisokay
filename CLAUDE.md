## Project: okaykayo Artist Website

### Overview
Create an artist website for **okaykayo** — a bold, emotionally-driven musician with a dreamy aesthetic.
The site should be vibrant, colorful, and expressive, incorporating pastel blues, pinks, purples, and soft whites.

---

### Overall Design
- **Background:** Soft gradient or abstract wash of pastel blues, pinks, and purples; subtle shifting or light animation for a dreamy effect.
- **Overlay:** Floating or faded floral and butterfly visuals; layered PNG or SVG elements with light animation or parallax.
- **Fonts:** Playful but readable. Modern serif or rounded sans-serif with personality. All text lowercase.
- **Hover Effects:** Smooth glow or shimmer with gentle enlargement.

### Navigation Layout (Always Visible)
- Top center: Glowing okaykayo logo. Clicking it smoothly fades to homepage.
- Vertical/sidebar navigation below logo with glowing pastel button links:
  - listen
  - follow

  - support
